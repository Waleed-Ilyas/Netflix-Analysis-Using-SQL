I'm thrilled to share my latest project where I used SQL to unlock fascinating insights from Netflix’s movie and TV show data! This project delves into some key business questions to better understand the platform's content and trends.

## Some key insights include:

🎥 Count of Movies vs. TV Shows

⭐ The most common ratings for Netflix content

🌍 Top 5 countries producing the most content

⏳ Identifying the longest movie and latest releases

🎬 Finding content without directors and starring top actors

This project allowed me to further enhance my SQL skills while exploring Netflix's vast dataset.
